2025-07-23,** Buy,** 0.85,"** SOL has been in a strong uptrend over the last 30 days, with a significant increase in price and trading volume.

Additionally, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) has broken out above 70, suggesting a potential continuation of the uptrend. However, it's essential to note that the price has been volatile in recent days, and a pullback cannot be ruled out. Therefore, I recommend buying SOL with a moderate risk appetite."
